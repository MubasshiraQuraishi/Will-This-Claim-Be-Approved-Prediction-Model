### Project Summary: Claim Approval Prediction Model

In this project, I developed a predictive model to forecast the likelihood of insurance claim approvals. The dataset contained over 200,000 entries with features such as claim type, claim site, airport, airline, and incident dates.

**Steps Involved:**
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: 
   - Removed irrelevant rows, handled missing values, and standardized data formats to ensure data quality.
   - Dropped duplicates and outliers to enhance data integrity.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Identified patterns and trends in claim types, amounts, and airline-related incidents.
   - Discovered key factors impacting claim approval rates, such as specific airports and claim types.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Implemented multiple models, with **CatBoost Classifier** yielding the best results due to its efficiency in handling categorical features and avoiding overfitting.
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² score, indicating strong predictive accuracy.

**Outcome & Insights**:
- The model effectively predicts whether a claim will be approved based on past claim data.
- **CatBoost** was the most successful model due to its advantages:
  - Handles categorical data without extensive preprocessing.
  - Robust against overfitting and delivers high accuracy even on imbalanced datasets.
  - Fast training and efficient with default settings, making it ideal for large datasets like ours.

Overall, the model demonstrated reliable performance, providing actionable insights for optimizing the claim approval process and improving financial decision-making.
